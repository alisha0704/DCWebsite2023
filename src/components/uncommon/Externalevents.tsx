      We think that dance, especially for young minds, may be a very effective tool for joy and self-expression. We recognised an opportunity to realise this thrill when Springdays School in Vellore invited VIT Dance Club. For the fourth and fifth grade students, we held a dynamic dance session that was full of fun, excitement, and energy. With great enthusiasm, the pupils engaged in dance and learnt valuable lessons about confidence, coordination, and teamwork. They found new ways to express themselves and create enduring memories with each beat and stride. It was evident from seeing their smiles during the dance that the session was a success and that everyone had a great time.
